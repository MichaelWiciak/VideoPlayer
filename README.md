## Introduction (see videos for presentation)

HTVP (Hot Tomato Video Player) is a responsive, feature-rich video player built using the desktop Qt framework (version 5.15.2).

Throughout development, we followed agile methodologies, using Kanban boards to manage tasks and user feedback to guide iterations.

## Key Features

- Basic media controls: play, pause, fast-forward, and rewind.
- Volume slider and mute button.
